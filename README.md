# Math_Game-CODE
This repository contains the source code for a math game which was initially developed to actively involve users in mathematics while having fun. Three levels were developed using python packages where the users can choose the difficulty level and  choose how many questions they want to answer. The questions are based on basic arithmetic functions like addition, substraction, multiplication and etc. Then all the user information like number of correct answers, score, name will be added to a database built  using SQL and in the end users will be able to see all the information printed on a table.
